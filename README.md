infolounge_walls
================

Built on top of [Swipe.js](http://swipejs.com/) (old 2.0 branch) and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/), this is a work in progress for [two huge touchscreens](http://blogs.walkerart.org/newmedia/2012/12/17/out-with-the-dialog-table-in-with-the-touch-wall/). It allows swipe and zoom, and basic HTML5 media tags.

Due to various CSS compromises to optimize the experience, the slide transitions only work properly at 1920x1080

You may need to run "grunt watch" to compile any assets as you change them.
