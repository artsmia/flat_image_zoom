infolounge_walls
================

Built on top of [Swipe.js](http://swipejs.com/) (old 2.0 branch) and [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/), this is a work in progress for [two huge touchscreens](http://blogs.walkerart.org/newmedia/2012/12/17/out-with-the-dialog-table-in-with-the-touch-wall/). It allows swipe and zoom, and basic HTML5 media tags.

Admin and documentation forthcoming as we refactor in the next week or two.
